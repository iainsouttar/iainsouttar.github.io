# About me
I am an Innovation Research Associate (InRA) at CAMaCS, University of Warwick, brooadly interested in interdisciplinary mathematics. Before this I was a PhD student in the MAC-MIGS centre for doctoral training at the Maxwell institute graduate school, based in Heriot-Watt university under the supervision of Michela Ottobre and Ben Goddard. My more specific academic interests lie in but are not limited to mathematical modelling, applied probability, stochastic analysis and mathematical biology. You can check out a (possibly out of date) version of my CV [here](./cv.pdf).

# Academic Side interests
I am more generally interested in the philosophy of science, and the interplay between science and decision making. This has led myself and Joe Colvin, a former PhD colleague of mine, to record some discussions with a number of experts in mathematical modelling, see [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1hDp_1BRhkcDOJuNzKXZ1A) for these. I very occassionally blog, and you can see a list (I use this term loosely) below.

# Bikepacking/Camping
I also love to go on A-B journeys with my bike or my own two feet. My two favourites being a 22 day Edinburgh-London walk and cycling over to and around Mull from Edinburgh.
