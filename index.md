# About me
I am a PhD student in the MAC-MIGS centre for doctoral training at the Maxwell institute graduate school, based in Heriot-Watt university under the supervision of Michela Ottobre and Ben Goddard. My academic interests lie in but are not limited to mathematical modelling, applied probability, stochastic analysis and mathematical biology. You can check out a (possibly out of date) version of my CV [here](./cv.pdf).

# Papers
1.  D. Crisan, P. Dobson, B. Goddard, M. Ottobre, and I. Souttar, Poisson equations
with locally-lipschitz coefficients and uniform in time averaging for stochastic differential
equations via strong exponential stability, 2022. Available as [arXiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02679). _Submitted_.
1.  B.D. Goddard, M. Ottobre, K. Painter, and I. Souttar. On Averaging,  when the fast process has multiple invariant measures, 2023. Available as [arXiv preprint](). _Submitted_.

# Academic Side interests
I am more generally interested in the philosophy of science, and the interplay between science and decision making. This has led myself and Joe Colvin, a former PhD colleague of mine, to record some discussions with a number of experts in mathematical modelling, see [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1hDp_1BRhkcDOJuNzKXZ1A) for these. I very occassionally blog, and you can see a list (I use this term loosely) below.

# Bikepacking/Camping
I also love to go on A-B journeys with my bike or my own two feet. My two favourites being a five day Edinburgh-London cycle and cycling over to and around Mull from Edinburgh. Ask me about my trips, I'll probably want to talk about them for longer than you'll want to listen!
